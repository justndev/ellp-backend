## 📡 API Endpoints for React Native client
Endpoints respond with this DTO pattern:
```json
{
  "result": "error" | "success",
  "message?": "Error details",
  "data": { ... },
}
```

### 1️⃣ Check subscription

As the mobile application users have QR codes to prove their subsription to collaborators, there is a endpoint for handling this, because QR code it basically an URL linked with this endpoint checking specific email.

**Possible Responses:**
- User not found
- Member has active subscription
- Activation required 

**Endpoint:**  
```
GET /api/members/check?email={email}
```
### 2️⃣ Query Member Profile
Retrieve a member's profile using an email or member ID. The developers must consider that initially WP Membership API query endpoint returns **hashed password** within the json! 

Current implementation handles it and removes sensetive data.

**Endpoint:**  
```
GET /api/members/query?email={email}&member_id={id}
```
**Response if success:**  
```json
{
    "result": "success",

                "memberId": "12345",

                "accountState": "active",
                ...
            }
}
```
**Response if failure:**
